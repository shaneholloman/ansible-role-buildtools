# Ansible Role: `buildtools`

[![CI](https://github.com/shaneholloman/ansible-role-buildtools/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/shaneholloman/ansible-role-buildtools/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Install buildtools on your system.

## Example Playbook

This example is taken from [`molecule/default/converge.yml`](https://github.com/shaneholloman/ansible-role-buildtools/blob/main/molecule/default/converge.yml) and is tested on each push, pull request and release.

```yml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: shaneholloman.buildtools
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using [`molecule/default/prepare.yml`](https://github.com/shaneholloman/ansible-role-buildtools/blob/main/molecule/default/prepare.yml):

```yml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes

  roles:
    - role: shaneholloman.bootstrap
```
